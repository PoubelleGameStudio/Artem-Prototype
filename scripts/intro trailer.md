Hi, I'm Artem and shit's pretty fkd right now. I'm part of an organization known as the Eye. Some of us are overqualified park rangers, but others, such as myself, travel the land
searching for knowledge either lost or never found. Anyway, this lady let me crash at her house which was super nice of her but I touched the wrong book and now I'm stuck in 
Grim's Briar. Place seem's pretty terrible. It's full of giant squirrels, ghosts, angrier ghosts, and those damn techies, but that at least means there's probably some fun ancient knowledge
lurking about.  The local's do seem variably deranged, though I can't exactly blame them. Anyway, come check things out and let's save the world.
